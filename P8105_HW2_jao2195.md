P8105_HW2_jao2195
================

## Homework 2

### Problem 0

This “problem” focuses on structure of your submission, especially the
use git and GitHub for reproducibility, R Projects to organize your
work, R Markdown to write reproducible reports, relative paths to load
data from local files, and reasonable naming structures for your files.

To that end:

-create a public GitHub repo + local R Project; we suggest naming this
repo / directory -p8105_hw2_YOURUNI (e.g. p8105_hw2_ajg2202 for Jeff),
but that’s not required

-create a single .Rmd file named p8105_hw2_YOURUNI.Rmd that renders to
github_document

-create a subdirectory to store the local data files, and use relative
paths to access these data files

-submit a link to your repo via Courseworks

-Your solutions to Problems 1 (not graded), 2, and 3 should be
implemented in your .Rmd file, and your git commit history should
reflect the process you used to solve these Problems.

For this Problem, we will assess adherence to the instructions above
regarding repo structure, git commit history, and whether we are able to
knit your .Rmd to ensure that your work is reproducible. Adherence to
appropriate styling and clarity of code will be assessed in Problems 1+
(only 2 and 3 will be graded).

### Problem 1

This problem uses the FiveThirtyEight data; these data were gathered to
create the interactive graphic on this page. In particular, we’ll use
the data in pols-month.csv, unemployment.csv, and snp.csv. Our goal is
to merge these into a single data frame using year and month as keys
across datasets.

First, clean the data in pols-month.csv. Use separate() to break up the
variable mon into integer variables year, month, and day; replace month
number with month name; create a president variable taking values gop
and dem, and remove prez_dem and prez_gop; and remove the day variable.

             mutate(prez_gop = replace(prez_gop, prez_gop==2, 1 )) %>% #changing 2s to 1s per above
             mutate(president = ifelse(prez_gop == '1', 'GOP', 'DEM'))%>% 
             select(-day, -prez_gop, -prez_dem)
```

``` r
#head(pols_month2)
#View(pols_month2)
#unique(pols_month2$prez_gop)
```

Second, clean the data in snp.csv using a similar process to the above.
For consistency across datasets, arrange according to year and month,
and organize so that year and month are the leading columns.

``` r
snp = read_csv("snp.csv") |> 
  separate(date, into= c("month", "day", "year")) |>
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year)) |>
  mutate(year = if_else(year <= 15, year + 2000, year)) |>
  mutate(year = if_else(year >= 15, year + 1900, year)) |>
  select(year, month, close) 
```

    ## Rows: 787 Columns: 2
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (1): date
    ## dbl (1): close
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
#class(snp$year)
#unique(snp$year)
#View(snp2)
#left_join(x = _, y = month_df) %>% 
```

Third, tidy the unemployment data so that it can be merged with the
previous datasets. This process will involve switching from “wide” to
“long” format; ensuring that key variables have the same name; and
ensuring that key variables take the same values.

``` r
unemployment = read_csv("unemployment.csv")
```

    ## Rows: 68 Columns: 13
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl (13): Year, Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
unemployment = unemployment %>% 
  rename(year = Year) %>% 
  pivot_longer(Jan:Dec, 
    names_to = "month_abb",
    values_to = "unemployment" ) %>% 
  select(year, month_abb, unemployment)

#View(unemployment)
```

Join the datasets by merging snp into pols, and merging unemployment
into the result.

``` r
final_data = 
  left_join(pols_month2, snp) |>
  left_join(x = _, y = unemployment)
```

    ## Joining with `by = join_by(year, month)`
    ## Joining with `by = join_by(year)`

    ## Warning in left_join(x = left_join(pols_month2, snp), y = unemployment): Detected an unexpected many-to-many relationship between `x` and `y`.
    ## ℹ Row 13 of `x` matches multiple rows in `y`.
    ## ℹ Row 1 of `y` matches multiple rows in `x`.
    ## ℹ If a many-to-many relationship is expected, set `relationship =
    ##   "many-to-many"` to silence this warning.

``` r
#str(final_data)
#View(final_data)
```

Write a short paragraph about these datasets. Explain briefly what each
dataset contained, and describe the resulting dataset (e.g. give the
dimension, range of years, and names of key variables).

The `pols_month2` data has 822 observations and 9 variables and tells us
about the party affiliation distribution (democrat or republican) for
governors and senators for a given year from years 1947 to 2015. It also
tells us whether the sitting president was a democrat or republican. The
`snp` data has 787 observations and 3 variables, ranging from years 1950
to 3915. The `unemployment` data has 816 observations and 3 variables
ranging from years 1948 to 2015. In Januarys in or after 1975 in which a
democrat was president, the **average unemployment rate was NaN**. The
average unemployment rate over the same time period in which a
republican was president was NaN.

Note: we could have used a date variable as a key instead of creating
year and month keys; doing so would help with some kinds of plotting,
and be a more accurate representation of the data. Date formats are
tricky, though. For more information check out the lubridate package in
the tidyverse.

### Problem 2

This problem uses the Mr. Trash Wheel dataset, available as an Excel
file on the course website.

1)  Read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet
2)  Specify the sheet in the Excel file and to omit non-data entries
    (rows with notes / figures; columns containing notes) using
    arguments in read_excel use reasonable variable names
3)  Omit rows that do not include dumpster-specific data

### \[Dataset A\] Mister Trashwheel Cleaning Process

``` r
#Reading/Cleaning/and Creating ID Variable for the sheet Mister Trash Wheel Data
mrtrashwheel<- read_excel("202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 
                sheet = 1,                   # Specifying Sheet in Excel File
                skip = 1,                    # Using Skip argument to skip first header with image in sheet
                 ) %>% 
               janitor::clean_names() %>%    # Cleaning the data
               mutate(SHEET_ID = "MISTER") %>%   # Creating new ID column to identify this sheet
               select(-x15, -x16)  %>%     # Omitting random blank columns X15 and X16 in dataset
               select(SHEET_ID, everything()) %>%  # Moving the Sheet ID to the beginning/ front of the dataset
               drop_na() %>% # Dropping rows that do not have dumpster specific data
               mutate(year = as.numeric(year)) #changing from character to numeric/double to merge
```

    ## New names:
    ## • `` -> `...15`
    ## • `` -> `...16`

``` r
#Viewing Mister Trash Wheel Data 
#View(mrtrashwheel)
#month = month[as.numeric(month)] 
#class(mrtrashwheel$year)
```

4)  The data include a column for the (approximate) number of homes
    powered. This calculation is described in the Homes powered note,
    but not applied to every row in the dataset. Update the data to
    include a new homes_powered variable based on this calculation.

``` r
#Overwriting the existing mrtrashwheel "homes_powered" column with the correct calculations. 
mrtrashwheel = mrtrashwheel %>%  
                    mutate(homes_powered =(weight_tons*500)/30)

# Checking out the change the the dataset.
#View(mrtrashwheel)
```

5)  Use a similar process to import, clean, and organize the data for
    Professor Trash Wheel and Gwynnda, and combine these with the
    Mr. Trash Wheel dataset to produce a single tidy dataset. To keep
    track of which Trash Wheel is which, you may need to add an
    additional variable to all datasets before combining.

                skip = 1,                    # Using Skip argument to skip first header with image in sheet
                 ) %>% 
               janitor::clean_names() %>%    # Cleaning the data
               mutate(SHEET_ID = "PROFESSOR") %>%   # Creating new ID column to identify this sheet
               select(SHEET_ID, everything()) %>% # Moving the Sheet ID to the beginning/ front of the dataset
               drop_na() %>%  # Dropping rows that do not have dumpster specific data
               mutate(sports_balls ="") %>% #Adding sportsball column for merge later; Does not contain sportballs column
               relocate(sports_balls, .before = homes_powered) %>% 
               mutate(sports_balls = as.numeric(sports_balls)) 
#Viewing ProfessorTrash Wheel Data 
#View(proftrashwheel)

### \[Dataset C\] Gwynnda Trashwheel Cleaning Process

``` r
gwynndatrashwheel <- read_excel("202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 
                sheet = 4,                   # Specifying Sheet in Excel File
                skip = 1,                    # Using Skip argument to skip first header with image in sheet
                 ) %>%

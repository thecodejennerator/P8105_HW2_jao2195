### Problem 1

This problem uses the FiveThirtyEight data; these data were gathered to
create the interactive graphic on this page. In particular, we’ll use
the data in pols-month.csv, unemployment.csv, and snp.csv. Our goal is
to merge these into a single data frame using year and month as keys
across datasets.

First, clean the data in pols-month.csv. Use separate() to break up the
variable mon into integer variables year, month, and day; replace month
number with month name; create a president variable taking values gop
and dem, and remove prez_dem and prez_gop; and remove the day variable.

Second, clean the data in snp.csv using a similar process to the above.
For consistency across datasets, arrange according to year and month,
and organize so that year and month are the leading columns.

Third, tidy the unemployment data so that it can be merged with the
previous datasets. This process will involve switching from “wide” to
“long” format; ensuring that key variables have the same name; and
ensuring that key variables take the same values.

Join the datasets by merging snp into pols, and merging unemployment
into the result.

Write a short paragraph about these datasets. Explain briefly what each
dataset contained, and describe the resulting dataset (e.g. give the
dimension, range of years, and names of key variables).

Note: we could have used a date variable as a key instead of creating
year and month keys; doing so would help with some kinds of plotting,
and be a more accurate representation of the data. Date formats are
tricky, though. For more information check out the lubridate package in
the tidyverse.

### Problem 2

This problem uses the Mr. Trash Wheel dataset, available as an Excel
file on the course website.

1)  Read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet
2)  Specify the sheet in the Excel file and to omit non-data entries
    (rows with notes / figures; columns containing notes) using
    arguments in read_excel use reasonable variable names
3)  Omit rows that do not include dumpster-specific data

mrtrashwheel<- read_excel("202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 
                sheet = 1,                   # Specifying Sheet in Excel File
                skip = 1,                    # Using Skip argument to skip first header with image in sheet
                 ) %>% 
               janitor::clean_names() %>%    # Cleaning the data
               mutate(SHEET_ID = "MISTER") %>%   # Creating new ID column to identify this sheet
               select(-x15, -x16)  %>%     # Omitting random blank columns X15 and X16 in dataset
               select(SHEET_ID, everything()) %>%  # Moving the Sheet ID to the beginning/ front of the dataset

```

4)  The data include a column for the (approximate) number of homes
    powered. This calculation is described in the Homes powered note,
    but not applied to every row in the dataset. Update the data to
    include a new homes_powered variable based on this calculation.

``` r
#Overwriting the existing mrtrashwheel "homes_powered" column with the correct calculations. 
mrtrashwheel = mrtrashwheel %>%  
                    mutate(homes_powered =(weight_tons*500)/30)

# Checking out the change the the dataset.
```

5)  Use a similar process to import, clean, and organize the data for
    Professor Trash Wheel and Gwynnda, and combine these with the
    Mr. Trash Wheel dataset to produce a single tidy dataset. To keep
    track of which Trash Wheel is which, you may need to add an
    additional variable to all datasets before combining.

                skip = 1,                    # Using Skip argument to skip first header with image in sheet

               janitor::clean_names() %>%    # Cleaning the data
